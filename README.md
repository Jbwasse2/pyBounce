# pyBounce
Robot bouncing simulation
This simulation was started by Chris Horn (https://github.com/Gadget212) for a research project under Alli Nilles that consisted of simulating bouncing robots that can imitate swarm behavior. My goal is to implement the algorithm done in this paper http://robotics.cs.tamu.edu/dshell/papers/irc2017coverage.pdf. To do this goal I will need to add walls and more dynamic enviornments to the current project as well as to refactor the code to make it more readable. Another goal is to implement weaselball behavior.
